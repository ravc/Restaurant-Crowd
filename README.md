# Restaurant-Crowd
A website that will determine how crowded a restaurant currently is

Red means that the restautant is 75% or more crowded
Yellow means that that the restaurant is between 30 and 75% crowded
Green means that the restaurant is less than 30%
Blue means that we currently do not have data to find how crowded it is

To use this site edit the api key in config.py to your google api that has access to the Google Places API Web Service

To run this code once you put your api key go to the directory containing this repo and run 'python server.py'
